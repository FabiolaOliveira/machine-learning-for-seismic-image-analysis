Various inputs to the image 'slice and dice' experiment (AKA experiment0).

- original-event-points, original-noevent-points
	Files provided by a mysterious source within the GGA/CEPETRO. They contain picks (selected points)
	of 'event' and 'no event' locations, respectively, for sunset-stackeds.sgy. In each file, there are 2 columns of floats with (CDP, time (ms)) values for each point.

- event-points.json, noevent-points.json
	The picks provided by GGA/CEPETRO, now represented in a more descriptive JSON format, where the points are in the more useful
	[[time_index1, trace_index1], [time_index2, trace_index2], ...] form.

- stack.su
	Seems very similar to sunset-stacked.sgy. At least the scale is different though

- sunset-stacked.sgy
	CMP stacked image (as far as I even understand what that means) 
	of seismic amplitudes obtained from a synthetic (simulated) seabed.
	The shape of the seismic events involved is said to resemble a 'sunset'. 
	We use this image (the data herein) for experiment0.

- noisy-sunset-images/*.su
	Images generated from sunset-stacked.sgy via:
	```bash
	segyread tape=$SGY_INPUT_FILE | segyclean | suaddnoise -sn=$SIGNAL_TO_NOISE_RATIO > $OUTPUT_FILE
	```
	For more information look at the documentation for suaddnoise.

- *.png
	Various visualizations of input data. These are all generated from Jupyter Notebooks in the code folder.
	I find that it helps to view them first and then save from the matplotlib display window

- {train--,test--}*
	Folders with the training and test images, respectively, for experiment zero.
	Annotated with a name and a creation timestamp.
	Training folders have a subfolder for each class ('noevent', 'event')
	Test folders have traceX to traceY subfolders. Each one has the test images and a (JSON formatted) prediction results file (after classification has been done by NVIDIA DIGITS, that is). The test folder itself has a
	file with all the paths of all the test images
