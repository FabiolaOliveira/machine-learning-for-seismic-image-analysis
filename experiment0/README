As documented in the docstring of the experiment0.py script, 

"""
experiment0 involves the following steps:

    1. take an image (CMP stacked) of seismic amplitudes
    2. divide it up into windows of size w (w must be odd) centered at every possible pixel in the original image
    3. some of the windows for we which we have a class label
        ('event' or 'no event' depending on the classification of the central pixel)
        will be part of the training/validation set.
    4. all the other windows of the entire image will be part of the test set.
    5. we'll send POST requests to a running instance of an NVIDIA DIGITS server in order to:
        a) create a dataset
        b) create a model
        c) classify the test set, stashing the results
    6. since we don't necessarily have class labels for the test set,
        we will simply generate an image with a color map that reflects
        the probability of event/noevent at each pixel.
    7. we display the image
