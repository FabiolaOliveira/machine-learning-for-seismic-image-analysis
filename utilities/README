"""
Various modules/scripts with helpful functions.

dumptable.py, maketable.py, plot.py, pylga.py, pymei.py:
	Scripts provided by the Applied Geophysics Group. 
	pymei is useful for reading SEGY and SU files with the 'load' function,
	which you can use to obtain a list of Trace objects (by iterating over the object returned by pymei.load).
	
	The Trace objects have useful attributes: 
	(note: this could be all wrong. the GGA like to keep an air of mystery about this whole thing)

		data (has a sequence of ns 4 byte floats representing the trace amplitudes recorded during seismic data acquisition)
		gx (x coordinate of sensor position for the given trace)
		gy (y coordinate of sensor position)
		sx (x coordinate of source position)
		sy (y coordinate of source position)
		mx (x coordinate of midpoint between source and sensor)
		my (y coordinate of midpoint between source and sensor)
		hx (x coordinate of half-displacement between source and sensor)
		hy (y coordinate of half-displacement between source and sensor)
		cdp (index of a common depth point)
		ns (number of samples in trace)
		dt (sample interval in seconds)

proj_utilities.py:
	Various utility functions for running shell commands, printing stuff, loading seismic data, 
	using the NVIDIA Digits (JSON-based) "API", etc.
